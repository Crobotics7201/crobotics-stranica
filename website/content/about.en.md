# Something about us

Borna Massari had a vision in 2017 to start a robotics team and bring together a group of individuals with diverse skills and talents to create something extraordinary. He shared his bold idea with the Physics professor Patricija Nikolaus. The professor felt that it would be nearly impossible to collect enough money for the competition, as the expenses would be too high. She believed that there were many other factors that would work against them, such as a lack of resources, facilities, and support from the government. Despite these challenges, Borna was determined to make his dream a reality. He saw the potential for growth and learning that participating in the competition would bring, and he was willing to work hard to overcome any obstacle in his way, so the professor finally gave in. Lucija Žužić, Andrej Čizmarević, Darijan Jelušić, Elizaveta Chernova, Ian Golob, Luka Grebo and the Computer science professor Goran Boneta were excited to join Borna in this endeavor, and so the Crobotics#7201 team was created. Despite facing financial challenges and limited resources, the team was able to come together and pay the participation fee for the New York FIRST competition.

However, the road to success was not easy for the team. They faced many difficulties along the way, including a shortage of funds and inadequate resources. But despite these obstacles, they persevered and arrived at the New York FIRST competition with a robot that was built for just 400 dollars.

The competition was intense, with teams from all over the world showcasing their robots and competing against each other. Our team was up against tough competition, but we were determined to give it our all. With our passion for robotics and our relentless spirit, we managed to surprise everyone with our innovative design and technical prowess. Our hard work paid off as the team won 2 prizes: The 2018 Rookie Inspiration Award and the 2018 Highest Rookie Seed Award, beating out teams with much larger budgets and more advanced robots. The team had shown the world that with dedication and perseverance, anything is possible. Borna’s team has overcome their financial limitations and proved that success is not about the resources you have, but about the creativity and determination you bring to the table.

The FIRST competition was forced to shift to an online format in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Teams from around the world were unable to gather in person so the competition was held virtually.  After we found out that the task for this year was pretty much the same as last, we began remodeling the robot. The first step was to dismantle the robot and build a new base.  Each person in the team was given a task, and so, the building of the robot began. We encountered some problems, but nothing we couldn’t solve. In the end, we placed 19th in our group.

Our team was unable to participate in the FIRST competition in 2022. Despite our hard work and dedication, we were unable to secure the necessary funds to cover the costs associated with participating in the competition. This included expenses such as travel, accommodation, and equipment costs, among others. This was a major setback for us as we had been preparing for the competition for months and had high hopes for our performance. The team's lack of funding was a disappointment to all those involved, as it meant we could not demonstrate our skills and abilities on the world stage. However, we haven’t lost sight of our goal and continue to work hard towards achieving its objectives.
