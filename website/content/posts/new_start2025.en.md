# A New Robot

In previous years, our robot used a six-wheel drive, which limited its movement capabilities. It could move forward and backward and rotate in place, unlike most of our opponents’ robots, which could move in all directions. This year, we decided to switch from the so-called tank drive to a swerve drive system.

To build our new robot, we started with the construction of the frame. We then mounted the wheels, which were not cheap. They are an important investment for us, as we hope they will serve us well in the coming seasons too.

We were satisfied with the work done so far, but we still needed to add all the electronics and connect the motors. This process took some time, as we put a lot of effort into keeping everything neat and well-organized.
