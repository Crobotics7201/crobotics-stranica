# Guests from Sarajevo

This week we had the opportunity to host students from the First Gymnasium Sarajevo. They had the chance to attend a presentation about our robotics competitions.

Our students presented our school robot to the guests from Sarajevo. We also talked to them about the competitions we have participated in, the places we have travelled to, and the results we achieved. The guests listened with great interest to our experiences and achievements.

After the presentation came the robot driving demonstration. This was everyone’s favorite part and they all enjoyed it. Our students showed them how to start and control the robot, and then the students from the First Gymnasium Sarajevo also had the opportunity to drive the robot themselves.

This meeting meant a lot to all of us because we are glad that we can host other schools and show them what we do best.
