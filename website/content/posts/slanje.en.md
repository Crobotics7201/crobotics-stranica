# Finishing Touches

The last two weeks with the robot were intense. The team worked late every day, sometimes even skipping classes. The toughest part was building the telescopic lift we mentioned earlier, we had to rebuild it twice because of technical issues.

During this time, the mechanics had so much on their plate that everyone jumped in to help. While some were finishing the lift, others were assembling the rest of the robot.

We finally completed it just one day before shipping, which unfortunately didn’t leave us much time for testing or driving practice.

### The Building Process

Yesterday, March 17th, we packed the robot into a crate and sent it off to the USA. The most important part is now behind us, and the team has finally earned a well-deserved break. Some of us are a bit worried about whether it will survive the long trip without any damage and arrive in the same shape we sent it in, but we’ll only find that out once we’re in Chicago.
