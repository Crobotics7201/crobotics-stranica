## The Robot is Connected

This week we finally brought our robot to life! After lots of work and wiring, we managed to get everything to a stage where the robot can actually drive.

First we finished connecting all the wires, then we started working on the autonomous part. That’s the first 15 seconds of the match when the robot drives by itself, without help from the driver. After that we began making the bumpers, which are important to protect the robot and meet the competition rules.

We had an issue because the CAN communication wasn’t working. CAN is the system that connects the motors and sensors, so without it the robot can’t function properly. After a bit of research and testing, we found the problem and fixed it successfully.

Once we solved that, the robot drove successfully. It felt really good, and we were all happy because our hard work finally started to show.
