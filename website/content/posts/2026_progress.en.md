Progress on the Robot

As our team intensively prepares for the FIRST Robotics Competition 2026 in Chicago, work on the robot is entering a more serious phase.

In recent days, our robotics team has been focused on developing the shooter, a key mechanism that will be used to launch balls during the game.


The shooter consists of two plates made according to the KitBot instructions. KitBot is a versatile, beginner-friendly robotics kit included in the FIRST Robotics Competition Kickoff package. Through it, all registered teams gain access to assembly instructions, CAD files, programming guides, and upgrade tips to help prepare their team for the competition.

Last week, we also received the main plates made of thick aluminum, precisely laser-cut. The plates arrived from the Faculty of Engineering in Rijeka, which supports our team to ensure that the robot and its components are as high-quality and accurate as possible.

We have also begun planning and building the intake, the part of the robot through which balls enter the system before being launched.

To properly test the robot, we built game elements including the bump and the hub. These elements were made from an old wardrobe and tables, which only proves our resourcefulness, creativity, and ability to work with what is available to us.

At the same time, we assembled the power distribution board with electronics, giving the robot its own “electronic core.”

Our team has successfully completed testing of the shooter design, and in the following videos you can see how we used a drill to rotate a shaft with a spinning wheel that launches balls into the air.

These are just some of the many steps on the road to Chicago, but every new part of the robot brings us closer to our goal. We continue with work, testing, and improvements, and we can’t wait to see the robot in action at the competition.

Of course, none of this would be possible without your support, as well as our sponsors and donations that help us on the path to great success. We also owe special thanks to the Faculty of Engineering in Rijeka for helping us develop ideas and providing parts.
