On February 9, we were visited by a crew from Kanal Ri who filmed a report about our robotics team and our preparations for the First Robotics Competition 2026 in Chicago. In a pleasant atmosphere, we showed them our classroom 401, where we prepare for the competition, as well as what our robot looks like, how we build and program it, and how much effort, time, and teamwork go into everything.

Some of our team members gave short statements about the competition itself and the challenges we face. The goal of this filming was to bring our work closer to a wider audience, raise awareness about robotics, and encourage the community to support us on our journey to the USA.

We would like to thank Kanal Ri for their visit, interest, and support, and to everyone who follows us – thank you for every like, share, and donation. Every bit of support means a lot to us and helps us achieve our goal.
