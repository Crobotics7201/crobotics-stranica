# The Beggining

As we stripped the robot down to its bare bones, we took note of what worked well and what needed improvement for the upcoming season. This process gave us a better understanding of the inner workings of the robot, and helped us to identify areas for improvement in our design.

Once we had taken everything apart, we thoroughly cleaned and prepared each component for the new season. We made sure that all the gears and motors were in good working order, and replaced any parts that were damaged or worn.

# Building the Field

The field is a crucial part of the competition, and we worked hard to make sure it was constructed accurately and efficiently.

The first step was getting all the necessary parts for the field. We organized a trip to the supplier where we picked up all the materials we needed including the wooden boards, 2"x4" lumber, and misc.

Once we returned to the workshop, we got to work building the field. Some of the parts were a bit challenging to cut, but we were determined and finished building the field by the end of the week.

As we worked, we made sure to follow the official game manual closely, ensuring that the field was constructed according to the official specifications. Which will ensure that our testing conditions will be as close to the ones while competing.

# The End

Once we finished all field pieces, we called it a week and we started the long awaited cleaned up of the workspace.
