# The Challenge

FIRST announced this year’s challenge, called Reefscape. Our team gathered to study the task and understand what needed to be done. The challenge was both interesting and demanding, especially since this year we were building the robot entirely from scratch. While part of the team focused on finishing the robot’s base, others brainstormed ideas on how to best complete the assigned task.

# The Robot

Soon, the base of the robot was completed, and we were ready to continue building. It was time to program the robot and test its first movements. Everyone was thrilled when the robot moved for the first time and successfully drove down the hallway in front of our workshop.

The next step was to build the upper part of the robot. We started with simpler components, such as the battery holder and bumpers, but things quickly became more complex. To be able to place corals (PVC tubes from the challenge) in their designated spots, we needed to design and assemble a telescopic lift.
